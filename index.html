                <p>Hey everyone, my name is Peter Wu and I am from Brooklyn, New York. I am currently a rising senior at Midwood High School. Growing up, I have always been a very positive, hardworking and energetic kid and to this day I still am. Along with that, I have always been be in awe about the wonders that technology can create. The idea about being able to turn dreams into reality inspires me to purse a passion in the tech industry. In the future, I dream of being a CEO and a software engineer.</p>

                            During my free time, I like to travel around the city and other places. When I travel, I also enjoy taking photos and that lead to my love for photography. I have taken many photos of my adventures like the image here which is a picture that I took during a sunset at Coney Island!!!

                            Ever since the start of remote learning, I had a lot of free time and I started to develop a love for learning languages. Currently, I am learning Korean and I hope to be able to speak many languages in the future.

                            Ayyy coding!!! From middle school, I have always be in awe about how code can turn dreams into realities. When I first programmed my first game with blocks on Scratch and it came to life I jumped up and down. Since then, I took many coding classes and I am now also part of All Star Code.

                            I really enjoy playing and watching basketball. I would usually go the park with my friends to play pick-up games. My favorite team is the Brooklyn Nets.

            <p>During the summer of 2019, I volunteered at Angel Advantage Center and at that tutoring organization, I helped kids with their homework, along with the teachers when they needed it. I am currently a teacher volunteer at YAPA Kids, a student-led community organization where high school students teach students a variety of subjects. I decided to volunteer for YAPA Kids because I realized that the pandemic impacted many people and I wanted to be able to help in any way I can, so now I am a teacher at YAPA Kids and I teach kids how to code in Java.</p>
